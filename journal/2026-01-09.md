## Manual Notes: Github Structure for Project files a data processing 

I have worked on VS code to shift my projects in kaggle to repo in Github. 
for doing that, 
Making repo in Github Desktop, open it in VS code by Github DEsktop and then making the distribution of files. For Repo STREETPERCEPTION_ML, we have these folders :
Data
Notebooks 
Gitignore
Citations 
ReDME

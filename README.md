Overview
journal-automation is a lightweight, research-oriented automation project that explores how GitHub workflows, Python, and simple data structures can be used to support reflective journaling, planning, and decision-making.
The repository is intentionally minimal and transparent. It is designed as a learning-by-doing project rather than a polished application.
